                <p class="wow fadeIn">I'm a computer science student at Purdue University who wants to create software that's as much fun to use as it was for me to make. I'm ambitious, highly motivated, and am always looking for the next opportunity to challenge myself.
                I've participated in several hackathons, and am proficient in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. If you'd like to learn more about me, take a look at my resume and recent projects below.</p>
